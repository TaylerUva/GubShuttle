## Cross-platform macOS and iOS game programmed in the Swift language
#### Special features of the code of this game:
- Custom Button Node
- Adjusts Resolution based on iOS rotation or macOS window size
- Does not rely on SKS files for scenes and is instead set to device resolution
- Motion controls work regardless of device orientation
- Device orientation can be changed on the fly
- Cross-platform for iOS and macOS (tvOS is untested as I don't have an Apple TV)
- Version 1.0 Alpha was developed in only 1 week

This game was originally based off of [Brian Advent's Space Game Reloaded Swift Tutorial](https://github.com/brianadvent/SpaceGameReloaded) but has since become a game of its own, differing greatly from the tutorial with many custom code changes, game modes, a macOS version, additional physics, and new sprite assets.
