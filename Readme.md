This game was originally based off of [Brian Advent's Space Game Reloaded Swift Tutorial](https://github.com/brianadvent/SpaceGameReloaded) but has since become a game of its own, differing greatly from the tutorial with many custom code changes, game modes, additional physics, and new sprite assets.

Sprites designed by [Angela Kim](https://github.com/AngelaKimmy).
